- ELM327 Bluetooth or WIFI OBDII adapter
- [TTGO LoRa32-OLED ESP](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B09FYY8PBH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

### Steps

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manuel833/e-Golf-SOC-Display.git
   ```

2. Make the following changes in the code:
   ```cpp
   const char* DEVICE_NAME = "Golf"; // GerÃ¤tenamen des ESP
   const char* OBDII_NAME = "OBDII"; // OBDII Namen
   const char* BLUETOOTH_PIN = "1234"; // OBDII Bluetooth pin
   ```

3. Open the Arduino IDE and install the required libraries:
   - Go to **Sketch** -> **Include Library** -> **Manage Libraries...**
   - Search for `ELMduino` and install it
   - Search for `TFT_eSPI` and install it
   - Search for `BluetoothSerial` and install it

4. Upload the code to your TTGO LoRa32-OLED board.

5. Plug in your ELM327 Bluetooth OBDII adapter into your e-Golf or e-Up.

6. Power on the TTGO LoRa32-OLED display and it should connect to the OBDII adapter and start displaying the battery percentage.
